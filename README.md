# Awoogen
This mod adds in canines to your regular clangen experience!
This is a standalone mod and it does not have a lite or sprite pack version. This means it is not compatible with most other clangen mods, unless those mods state otherwise. Not compatible with lifegen.


The aim is to keep up to date with clangen dev version while adding new features. For this reason, some updates may take a while!

## Requirements
More than 4GB of RAM for Windows users - for others, Awoogen currently uses approx 3.1GB and is planned to use more in the future.

For running from source code:
Python, pygame-ce, and pygame_gui, along with several other requirements. It is best to use requirements.txt to install.


## Downloads
We are currently on Moonlight (1.1)
[Moonlight Download](https://github.com/Koriiy/awoogen/releases/tag/v1.1-moonlight)
Grab the version for your operating system and run like regular clangen!

## Themes
Currently there are two themes:

Moonlight - default Awoogen theme. It's a blue-purple theme

Classic - Awoogen with Clangen's classic brown theme.

Themes can be accessed by those running source code. Once the feature is out of Beta, theme selecter can be used by anyone.


## Running from Source Code
Simply download from Github and install requirements.txt with any method you're comfortable with, then run with main.py

You do not need to install requirements.txt if you have already done so with Clangen or another mod.


Not sure how to do this? Read here:
1. Download from Github. You can do this by clicking the green Code button, and selecting download ZIP

2. Extract to where you'd like to keep Awoogen. Saves will be kept wherever you extract to. When updating Awoogen, I recommend deleting the old contents entirely, except your saves, and extracting the new version. Overwriting the old one may lead to crashes.

3. If you've never used source code from any version of clangen or a mod, you should download Thonny. This will allow you to run from source with less complication typically.

4. Open Thonny and follow these instructions:

go to tools (top left) > manage packages > click 'here' (under install requirements file) > find requirements.txt, click and then click open > allow it to install

5. If everything worked, run using main.py from now on

Note that I don't provide support for running from source now that builds are available!

## Crashes and Bugs
Reminder that Awoogen comes with all of the bugs of Clangen dev, along with many of my own creation. If you care about your saves, back them up occasionally!

First time running Awoogen from source and encounter a crash? Please do not report this. Check Thonny for information on why it crashed. If it says out of memory, you do not meet the minimum RAM requirements to run, try closing other programs and running again. If it says anything else, there is likely something wrong with how requirements.txt was installed, or a bug with how Windows handles things at times.

Have you run Awoogen successfully at least once? Report the crash to me on Discord! Remember to include the full error so I can figure out what's happening. You can either DM me or ping me in the thread on Discord. Or you can try reporting on Github but I am new to the platform haha. Either way, thanks in advance!

Other bugs? Please report them as well. Only thoughts, ceremonies, events, and the entirety of the plains/mountains camps are intended to be scrubbed of cat-like words, so if you're playing on a different camp don't report those words for now thanks
